Many of us love Chinese and some of us even love 'desi Chinese' which is a typical Indian Chinese cuisine that has its history rooted in our soil which dates back to late eighteenth century. Then, gradually Chinese became India's most favourite cuisine. Owing to local demand and Chinese ingenuity, Chinese restaurants have been set up in almost every corner of the city.
